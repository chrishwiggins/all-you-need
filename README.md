This weekend someone sent me a Twitter thread with two recent papers with "...is all you need" in the title. It reminded me that, in the class "Data: past, present, and Future" (the "class" version of the book "How Data Happened") we recently assigned Steven Levy excellent piece on the paper that started it all, "Attention Is All You Need" introducing the Transformer architecture (the "T" of GPT) in 2017. It struck me that we will at some point reach peak "all you need" on arxiv.org, and made me wonder if it's a trend or just my own cognitive bias. It turns out the frequency of "all you need" is growing as t^{12} approximately (cumulative number of papers growing as t^{13}) so the date at which all new papers on the arxiv are "all you need" should be calculable. Source code on GitHub so you can track it yourself as we approach the all-you-need-a-geddon.
